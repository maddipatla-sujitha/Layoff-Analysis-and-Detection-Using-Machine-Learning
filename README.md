# Layoff-Analysis-and-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
	This project, titled ”Layoff Analysis and Detection Using Machine Learning”, aims to analyze historical layoff patterns and develop a predictive model that can anticipate potential layoff events within a company. Specifically, the project focuses on data from different companies Amazon, Wipro and Genpact between 2000 and 2024, incorporating variables such as revenue, net profit, employee strength, stock prices, department-wise data, and economic indicators. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, we build and validate a classification model—primarily using XGBoost to determine the likelihood of a layoff occurrence.
	The results demonstrate that machine learning techniques, when applied to a well-structured dataset, can effectively predict layoff trends with high accuracy. This study underscores the potential of AI-driven insights in shaping proactive HR and financial planning strategies, ultimately contributing to more resilient organizational structures.
